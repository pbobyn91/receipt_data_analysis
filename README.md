# Receipt Data Analysis

This project is about reading a receipt and using the data analysis to find patterns 
in purchases.

## Tesseract-OCR

This project requires an external application called Tesseract-OCR. To use this 
application go to: 
https://towardsdatascience.com/read-text-from-image-with-one-line-of-python-code-c22ede074cac.

To install this application download the correct .exe file from: 
https://github.com/UB-Mannheim/tesseract/wiki and follow the default installation 
settings. This should install into: C:\Program Files\Tesseract-OCR\tesseract.exe which
is required in read_receipt.py.

## Packages

All of the packages that are required for use are in the packages.txt file found in the
project directory packages/.

## Use

All you have to do is run the program and enter the image that you want to be read. There
is lots of future work for this project.
